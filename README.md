# Smartphone-Android-operated-Robot-using-Arduino
In current era, smart phone has become the most essential thing in our daily life. This research paper describes, Android operating system based robot platform and smart phone operated control and monitoring system are introduced. Many robots have been built for manufacturing purpose and can be found in factories around the world. The design of the robot is such that it is controlled by a mobile app. This project describes how to control a robot using mobile through Bluetooth communication, some features about Bluetooth technology, components of the mobile and robot. We present a review of robots controlled by mobile phone via moving the robot upward, backward, left and right side by the android application such as Arduino, Bluetooth. Here we are using Bluetooth communication, interface microcontroller and android application. We are using Arduino software to interface the Bluetooth module with microcontroller. According to commands received from android the robot motion can be controlled another thing is used in the project, that is spy camera. This robot is capable of spying using a wireless camera. This robot can be reprogrammable and can be interchanged to provide multiple applications
